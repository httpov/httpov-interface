The file tree should be installed in this manner:
=================================================
  httpov/            <-- The server's document root
    interface/
      templates/
        cache/
        compile/
      themes/
        blue/
      uploads/
    finished/
  interface_conf.php

Make sure the server is allowed to write to uploads, as this is used
when uplading jobs through the web interface. Also, finished has to be
writable by the server if the finished batches are to be placed there.
interface_conf.php is supposed to reside in the same directory as
httpov_conf.php.

Place Smarty, jQuery and TableSorter in 
Use of x.2 clients or newer is required for full functionality.
